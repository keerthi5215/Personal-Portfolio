# Personal-Portfolio
  Developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my full-stack development skills, including projects and contact information.
  The footer provides links to services, quick links, and contact information. CSS is used for styling, Google Fonts for typography, and JavaScript for interactive elements
  Designed a clean and intuitive user interface with a focus on user experience, utilizing modern design principles and accessibility standards.
